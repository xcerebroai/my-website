 * On-page registration form → GoHighLevel inbound webhook. When set, the form
 * in the Register section POSTs each signup here with these fields: firstName,
 * email, phone, source, submittedAt.
 *
 * GHL setup: Automation → Workflows → new workflow → trigger "Inbound Webhook"
 * → copy the webhook URL → paste it below. In the workflow, reference the
 * fields as {{inboundWebhookRequest.firstName}} / .email / .phone and add a
 * "Create/Update Contact" action (plus a tag like "First to Deal Challenge").
 *
 * Transport note: GHL webhooks don't send CORS headers, so the form fires a
 * "simple" request — mode:'no-cors' + form-urlencoded body — which needs no
 * preflight and reaches GHL reliably from a static page. The response is opaque,
 * so the form optimistically shows success once the request fires. Always send
 * one live test and confirm the contact lands before you go public.
